# compNeuroScience-Washington

Code used to study the lessons from Univ. of Washington's Computational Neuroscience, freely available in Coursera. 
Not complete, not always right, the code in this repo should not be taken any further than a weekend quick glance to the course.

Disclaimer: Some exercises are incomplete or were quickly done with little attention to details, or even were copied here from experiments that differ from the original question the course poses.
